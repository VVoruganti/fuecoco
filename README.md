# Fuecoco

This project is a set of scripts to interact with the Spotify API in order to
create a playlist with every song that you have not liked from every artist
where you have liked atleast one of their songs. 

The idea is to help better explore the artists you already like. 


## Pokemon 

I picked Fuecoco for the name because in [pokerogue](https://pokerogue.net/) I
use Skeledirge a lot and it can learn the hidden ability [Punk Rock](https://pokemondb.net/ability/punk-rock) so 
I thought why not use it for a music thing.
